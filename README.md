# Hotel-Maintence-Logger

At a company I used to work for, I noticed something interesting. They were handling all their maintenance requests with an old paper system. From front desk staff writing them to give them to maintenance, I felt like there were thousands of sticky notes everywhere. It just seemed terribly inefficient, and nobody could really track how things were being dealt with or when. So I decided to use my spare time to build something. My idea was to create a working example to show my manager what a modern approach could look like.

Currently this project is a command line application. That means you interact with it through text commands rather than clicking on buttons. It doesn't have a ui (user interface) but in an arvo I could build one up pretty easily. The goal here was to more get the basic programming logic down before adding more features. 

Where This Project Could Go? Looking ahead, I have several ideas for how this could be more involved. Firstly would be to building a ui (as mentioned above) to make it easier and more intuitive for someone to use. I've thought about using Kivy as this allows you to make something work on a mobile phone. This would allow the maintenance team to use there phones to make requests futhermore you could also allow funtionality to use photos. This would let them document their process, and each issue would be able to have a history. Therefore, you would better be able to predict longstanding issues that might need new parts, not a bandaid fixes and then you have a major issue happen and you need a part flown in by helicopter ... (to real for someone reading this I am sure.)

Then, if we had a lot of maintenance requests or if we needed to combine information from different parts of the business. Let's say the marina operations as well, I could add a proper database. Something like MongoDB would be a good choice there because it's flexible and can handle a lot of data and complex needs.

Beyond that, we could also add more features. For instance, it would be useful to assign tasks to specific people. We could set up notifications to alert staff about new tasks or updates. This sms compatibility would obviously need cell service or using a mesh network if wifi was bad. However mesh networks are a bit out of my league but with time I could sort it out I am sure. Just for anyone who wants to use this just please mention me. With this software it is registered as and open source liecence. 

Below is so photos for you to see I hope this helps :)
