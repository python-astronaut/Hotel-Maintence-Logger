# Hotel-Maintence-Logger

At a company I used to work for, I noticed something interesting. They were handling all their maintenance requests with an old paper system. From front desk staff writing them to give them to maintenance, I felt like there were thousands of sticky notes everywhere. It just seemed terribly inefficient, and nobody could really track how things were being dealt with or when. I thought there just had to be a better way to manage it all. So because of this feeling, I decided to use my spare time to build something. My idea was to create a working example to show the General Manager what a more modern approach could look like.

What This Project Is Right Now.
This project is a command line application. That means you interact with it through text commands rather than clicking on buttons. It doesn't have a visual user interface at the moment because my main goal was to get the basic logic and the system for managing the requests working first and prove that it could be done effectively this way.

Where This Project Could Go Next?
Looking ahead, I have several ideas for how this could grow. A big step would be to build a graphical user interface to make it easier and more intuitive for anyone to use. I've thought about using Kivy for that because Kivy is great for making really nice looking interfaces that can work on mobile phones. This would allow the maintenance team to interact in real time with their phones, uploading not only text but photos. This would let them document their process, and each issue would be able to have a history. Therefore, you would better be able to predict longstanding issues that might need new parts, not a bandaid fix.

Then, if the company had a lot of maintenance requests or if we needed to combine information from different parts of the business—say like the marina operations as well—we could add a proper database. Something like MongoDB would be a good choice there because it's flexible and can handle a lot of data and complex needs.

Beyond that, we could also add more features. For instance, it would be useful to assign tasks to specific people. We could set up notifications to alert staff about new tasks or updates. And building in some basic reporting could help give an overview of maintenance activities.
